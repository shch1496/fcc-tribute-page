              Nikola Tesla, a visionary inventor, electrical engineer, and
              futurist, left an indelible mark on the world through his
              groundbreaking contributions to science and technology. Born on
              July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Croatia, and passing away on January 7,
              1943, in New York City, USA, Tesla's life was a testament to
              unyielding curiosity and innovation.

            <h3>A Pioneer of Electrical Engineering</h3>
            <div class="divider small"></div>
            <p>
              Tesla's genius shone brightly in his pioneering work on
              alternating current (AC) electricity. His rivalry with Thomas
              Edison in the War of the Currents is legendary, where Tesla
              championed AC power transmission as a safer and more efficient
              alternative to Edison's direct current (DC). His AC system laid
              the foundation for modern electricity distribution, powering homes
              and industries across the globe.

            <h3>Revolutionary Inventions</h3>
            <div class="divider small"></div>

            <p>
              Among Tesla's numerous inventions, his development of the
              induction motor stands out as one of the most transformative. This
              invention drove the efficient conversion of electrical energy into
              mechanical power and found applications in industries ranging from
              manufacturing to transportation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tesla's visionary ideas extended beyond electricity. He envisioned
              wireless communication and experimented with the concept of a
              "World Wireless System," often referred to as a precursor to the
              internet. His work on radio technology paved the way for later
              advancements in telecommunications.

            <p>
              One of Tesla's most ambitious projects was the Wardenclyffe Tower,
              a facility intended to transmit wireless signals, including
              communication and power, across great distances. Although the
              project faced financial challenges and was never fully realized,
              it remains a symbol of Tesla's far-reaching imagination and desire
              to connect the world.
